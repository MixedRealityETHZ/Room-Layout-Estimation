# Room-Layout-Estimation-in-AR-MR2024
This repository provides a streamlined pipeline for room layout estimation in AR, optimized for Magic Leap 2. By integrating lightweight 2D boundary segmentation (ST-RoomNet), refined 2D and 3D line generation, and user-centric rendering, the system delivers robust performance and intuitive interaction. Clutter is reduced and structural clarity is enhanced, resulting in a comfortable, user-friendly experience. Future directions include exploring long-range depth sensing, advanced room layout models, and improved AR interfaces.

## 1. Environment Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## 2. Testing the Backend Part Locally

1. Open and run **`test.ipynb`** to see the entire process demonstrated with an example dataset.
2. This notebook walks through:
   - Initializing the environment
   - Loading images and metadata
   - Estimating layouts
   - Rendering results for inspection

## 3. Running on Magic Leap 2

For real-world usage on Magic Leap 2, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Monitoring Script**  
   Run **`run_monitor.bat`** to begin monitoring for new images. This script continuously checks for fresh data coming from the Magic Leap 2 device.

2. **Run the Data-Capture Script**  
   Execute **`newtxt.py`** in parallel. This script handles capturing new images from the device.

3. **Automatic Indexing**  
   Each newly captured image is automatically assigned an index in **`index.json`** located under the **`received_data`** folder, alongside:
   - The color image  
   - The depth image  
   - Associated metadata  

4. **Rendering**  
   Once the new images and metadata are received, the room layout estimation and rendering pipeline will process them for visualization.
  
## 4. Testing the Workflow Locally

1. Run **`run_monitor.bat`** and **`newtxt.py`** as explained above.
2. Manually add an index in **`index.json`**.
3. **Important Note**: Because Unity uses a left-hand coordinate convention, there are slight differences in how lines are rendered here (for real time case) compared to the methodes shown in Section 2 (for verification case, all right-hand assumptions used). Nonetheless, the final outcomes have been verified to be correct during real-world rendering.

**Enjoy exploring room layout estimation for AR/MR applications!**
